# Awesome Real-World Reinforcement Learning for Manipulation 🦾

A curated list of research papers on **real-world reinforcement learning for robotic manipulation**, where policies are trained or fine-tuned through **direct interaction with physical manipulators** (e.g., robotic arms, dexterous hands), rather than simulation-only or purely offline learning.

This list focuses on **end-to-end or policy-level reinforcement learning** applied to **real-world manipulation tasks**, including grasping, assembly, deformable object manipulation, and long-horizon dexterous control.
